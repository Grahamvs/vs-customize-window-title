**Description**

This lightweight extension will change the window title of Visual Studio to include a folder tree with a configurable min depth and max depth distance from the solution/project file, or using special tags to help with many other possible scenarios (git, TFS...).

Solution-specific overriding rules are available as well, which virtually allow for any possible need to be covered.

It can also be configured so that the renaming rules apply only when at least two instances of Visual Studio are running with the same window title. 

**Supported editions**

Visual Studio 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015+.
